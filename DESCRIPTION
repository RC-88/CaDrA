Description: Performs a stepwise heuristic search for candidate (epi)genetic drivers based on ranked multi-omic data. CaDrA's main objective is to identify features which, together, are significantly skewed or enriched pertaining to a given sample ranking variable (e.g. defined by pathway activity or drug sensitivity estimates), based on the union occurence (i.e. logical OR) of the events.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1)
