\title{Calculate row-wise scores of a given binary feature set based on
a given scoring method}
\usage{
calc_rowscore(
  FS_mat,
  input_score,
  method = c("ks_pval", "ks_score", "wilcox_pval", "wilcox_score", "revealer", "custom"),
  alternative = c("less", "greater", "two.sided"),
  weight,
  seed_names = NULL,
  custom_function,
  custom_parameters,
  do_check = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{FS_mat}{a matrix of binary features where 
rows represent features of interest (e.g. genes, transcripts, exons, etc...)
and columns represent the samples.}

\item{input_score}{a vector of continuous scores representing a phenotypic
readout of interest such as protein expression, pathway activity, etc.
The \code{input_score} object must have names or labels that match the column
names of FS object.}

\item{method}{a character string specifies a scoring method that is
used in the search. There are 4 options: (\code{"ks"} or \code{"wilcox"} or
\code{"revealer"} (conditional mutual information from REVEALER) or
or \code{custom} (a user-customized scoring method). 
Default is \code{ks}.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifies an alternative hypothesis
testing (\code{"two.sided"} or \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}).
Default is \code{less} for left-skewed significance testing.
NOTE: \code{Revealer} method only returns score statistics (no p-values).}

\item{weight}{if method is \code{ks}, specifies a vector of weights
to perform a weighted-KS testing. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{seed_names}{one or more features representing known “causes”
of activation or features associated with a response of interest.
It is used for \code{method = revealer} only.}

\item{custom_function}{if method is \code{"custom"}, just pass the name of the
customized function. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{custom_parameters}{if method is \code{"custom"}, specifies a list of
additional arguments (other than \code{FS} and \code{input_score}) to be passed
to the \code{custom_function()}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{do_check}{a logical value indicates whether or not to validate if the
given parameters (FS and input_score) are valid inputs. 
Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
return a vector of scores ordered from most significant to least
significant where its labels or names match the row names of FS_mat object
}
