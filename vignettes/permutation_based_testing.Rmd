**CaDrA** employs a forward/backward search algorithm to look for a subset of 
features whose union is maximally associated with an outcome of interest, 
based on one of the four scoring functions (**Kolmogorov-Smirnov**, 
**Conditional Mutual Information**, **Wilcoxon**, and **custom-defined**). 
To find out whether the set of features associated with the observed input 
scores (i.e. pathway activity, drug sensitivity, etc.) would happen by chance, 
**CaDrA** can perform a rigorous statistical significance testing based on the 
sample permutation to determine if there is an abnormality in the given 
response of interest while exploiting aspects of feature complementary and 
sample heterogeneity.

# Load required datasets

1. A `binary features matrix` also known as `Feature Set` 
(such as somatic mutations, copy number alterations, chromosomal 
translocations, etc.) The 1/0 vectors indicating the presence/absence of 
‘omics’ features in the samples. The `Feature Set` must be an object of class **ExpressionSet** from **Biobase** package) 
2. A vector of continuous scores (or `input_score`) represents a 
functional response of interest (such as protein expression, 
pathway activity, etc.)

```{r load.data}

# Load pre-simulated dataset 
# See ?sim.ES for more information
data(sim.ES)

# Generate a vector of sample-specific scores representing a functional 
# response of interest
set.seed(123)                             # set seed
input_score = rnorm(n = ncol(sim.ES))     # generate random scores
names(input_score) = colnames(sim.ES)     # label input_score with names 
                                          # similar to colnames of sim.ES

```

# Find a subset of features that maximally associated with a given outcome of interest

Here we are using **Kolmogorow-Smirnow** (KS) scoring method to search for 
best features

```{r ks.method}

ks_candidate <- CaDrA::candidate_search(
  ES = sim.ES,
  input_score = input_score,
  method = "ks",               # Use Kolmogorow-Smirnow scoring function 
  alternative = "less",        # one-sided p-value
  weights = NULL,              # If weights is provided, it will be used 
                               # to perform a weighted-KS test
  metric = "pval",             # Use p-value to search for best feature
  search_method = "both",      # Apply both forward and backward search
  top_N = 1,                   # Number of top features to kick start the search
  max_size = 10,               # Set max_size = 10 to account for 
                               # 10 left-skewed features in sim.ES
  best_score_only = FALSE      # If best_score_only = FALSE, it will 
                               # return meta-feature ESet, 
                               # its observed input scores and corresponding 
                               # best score
)

```

```{r ks.meta.plot}

# Extract the best meta-feature result
topn_best_meta <- topn_best(topn_list=ks_candidate)

# Visualize meta-feature result

```

# Permutation-based testing
